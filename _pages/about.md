I am currently a post-doctoral fellow within the [Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making CERC](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca) (Canada Excellence Research Chair) at Polytechnique Montr√©al. I am interested in improving operational research methods using deep learning, and working with Profs. [Andrea Lodi](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/person/dr-andrea-lodi/) and [Laurent Charlin](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/person/laurent-charlin/).

Research interests
======

* Machine learning for combinatorial optimization: can ML help solve CO problems ? (and vice versa).
* Probabilistic Graphical Models: theoretical properties of conditional independence models (directed, undirected, bi-directed, chain, mixed graphs), structure learning algorithms.
* Structured prediction: complex loss functions (0/1 error, F<sub>1</sub> error) minimization, learning of decomposable representations.
* Causal inference.
