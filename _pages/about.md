I am a machine learning researcher within the [Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca) Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC), and also part of the [MILA](https://mila.quebec/mila/) research institute on artificial intelligence in Montr√©al, Canada. The question that motivates my research is: can machines think?

My broad research interests include:
- **probabilistic graphical models** and their theoretical properties (my [PhD Thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01442613/document))
- **structured prediction**, in particular multi-label classification
- **combinatorial optimization** using machine learning (see our [Ecole](https://www.ecole.ai/) library)
- **causality**, in particular in the context of reinforcement learning

I am proud to serve the scientific community, and I have been rewarded _NeurIPS 2019 best reviewer_ (top 40%), _ICML 2020 best reviewer_ (top 30%), _NeurIPS 2020 top reviewer_ (top 10%), and _ICLR 2021 outstanding reviewer_ (top 10%).
