I am currently a [post-doc](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/person/maxime-grasse/) within the Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making CERC (Canada Excellence Research Chair), where I am interested in improving operational research methods using deep learning.

Research interests
======

* Probabilistic Graphical Models: theoretical properties as conditional independence models (directed, undirected, bi-directed, chain, mixed graphs), structure learning algorithms.
* Multi-label classification: minimizing complex loss functions such as 0/1 error and F<sub>1</sub> error.
* Deep learning: learn decomposable representations for structured prediction.
