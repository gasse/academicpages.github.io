I am a machine learning researcher within the [Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca) Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) led by Prof. Andrea Lodi, and also part of the [MILA](https://mila.quebec/mila/) research institute on artificial intelligence led by Prof. Yoshua Bengio.

I am deeply motivated by the following question: can machines think? Or more pragmatically, what are the limits of what machines can do? My broad research interests include **probabilistic graphical models** (directed, undirected, bi-directed, chain, mixed graphs) and their theoretical properties as independence models, **structured prediction** problems, questions regarding **causality**, and **combinatorial optimization** problems.
